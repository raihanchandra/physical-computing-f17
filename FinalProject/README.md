This thing can probably win EVO

Main Idea:
A robot arm that plays a fighting game on an arcade stick automatically. (manually if theres time)

Building Stuff:
+ Two robot arms
+ One controls the joystick
	- Servo motor attached to a clamp
	- Be able to move in all 8 directions
	- be able to push the joystick rapidly
	- "Accurate movement" 
+ One presses the buttons
	- 4 different metal bars that go up and down
	- Be able to press 2 or more buttons at once 
	- Be able to sync button presses with joystick inputs
+ Flair Finesse
	- Add LED's to each button arm and turns on whenever it presses
	- Make it do quarter circles/complex movements on joysticks


Coding Stuff:
+ Joystick movement
	- Omni-directional servo movement
	- Clamp write position to hold joystick
	- Creating sets of movements

	- executing random sets of movements
	- alternate back and forward movement
+ Button Pressing
	- Making the metal beams go up and down to push the buttowns
